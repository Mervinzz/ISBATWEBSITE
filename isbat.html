		<h2>A Glimpse of The Mandela Timeline!</h2>
		<p id="para1">
		My name is Donald Mandela Wangwabi. I am in my third year at university and i have everything i need to move from one day to another.You could say am comfortable.But it hasnt always been this way, as a matter of fact things were different as a young boy. As a child growing up, my family did not have a lot of money. Infact "poor" describes the exact situation. Getting something to eat was always a struggle and we had to survive a day at a time with no surity of the day after but some how the Lord some how provided.
		My dad and mum had me and my siblings before any of them had finished school and life was tough as money had to be managed in such a way that we got something to eat and also pay for dad's tuition fees since he was about to finish his University education leaving mum to take care of us the children. this put a strain on our school fees, lifestyle in regard to mecical care, clothes, food,movement to mention but afew but somehow we endured through.

		<h2>Ladder Of Success!</h2>
		<p id="para2">
		Before long, Dad graduated, got a job shortly after and then started a path of recovery. we started to eat well, went to better schools, medical care and clothing improved so drastically to the extent that we were shadow of our once miserable poor selves. Mum enrolled for a course at university and completed schoollife was very happy, we now had a good reason to look forward to the next day. Dad bought cars, bought land and built a house to call home, started a couple of companies. life was very good. But like the saying goes " the road to greatness is not always smooth and rosy, its filled with hardships and struggles". Dad made a couple of deals that didnt go as planned, he put most of the family's savings into it and he lost it all. it was back to square one. we had lost everything. I couldnt believe it. i refused to believe it and I just like all the family blamed dad for it. we were suffering koz of a mistake he had made. i didnt want mt friends to see me this way but I like any one else knew that it would be a matter of time before i couldnt hide it anymore. so i decided to take my dad's side like my entire family all decided. we united against the world, stood together, supported each other to save face of the family both in honor and intergrity. No matter what was thrown at us, i stood by my family, we stood together and united.

		<h2>One Exam(life)...Different Question Papers(challenges)!</h2>
		<p id="para3">
		Slowly and steadily things started working out again until everything lost had been restored. and it has stayed that way to date. i had decided to stick to my family, not be ashamed of our financial situation and our hardships. I decided to be loyal.
		my decision humbled not just my parents but my friends too whom for some reason i thought would make a joke out of my predicament but didnt. this choice impacted me the most though. i learned to be humble, patient and above understanding of other people's situations. This has made me more social too which not only influenced my character but also brought comfort to those around me especially my family.
